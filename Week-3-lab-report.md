# Aarush's Week 3 Lab Report 
*Hi, I'm Aarush! In this lab report, I'll be covering some new topics! 

# Part 1: Building a StringServer! 

# Part 2: ðŸ‘¾ Bug-fixing ðŸ‘¾
For this section of the report, I'll be talking about a bug I found in Week 3's `reverseInPlace()` method. Originally, this is what the method looked like: 
```java
// Changes the input array to be in reversed order
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
    arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
}
```
As you can see, the method above aimed to reverse the elements of the input array `arr` without creating a new array. Unfortunately, there was a clear bug- visible both by reading through the method and by running a JUnit test with the following input array: 
```java
Int[] input2 = {3, 5, 6, 7};
```

Reading the error message, it looks like the error appears on the second element of the arrayâ€“ so clearly, the issue isn't something about the actual copying of elements. It looks like there's a logic error in the code instead. Reading the code again, the error becomes clear: after the halfway point, the code simply copies the previously-copied element back to its original spot. 
> In effect, it's replacing only the first half of the array! 

It therefore follows that there are many other possible failure-inducing inputs. An input that doesn't induce failure would be an array with length 1, since the logic error only applies for arrays with length `n>1`. For example, the following array would be fine: 
```java
Int[] input2 = {3};
``` 

The success of this array can be seen in lines 7 and 8 of the right-hand pane in the screenshot above. 


To solve the logic error, we can make a change that will take slightly more memory, but cut runtime in half. *Fixing code? And making it faster in the process? Maybe Southwest Airlines should hire me :P*

By creating a temporary variable to store the original array element before replacing it with the reversed-equivalent on the opposite side, we don't "lose" the original element after the first step of the reversing process is complete. Because we still have the original element, we can use the same logic to place the overwritten element in the second half of the array. By doing twice the work in one iteration, we can also cut the loop time by half. For an array with an odd number of values in it, the middle element wouldn't change position when reversed anyway so we don't need to add any special code for that.

What does this look like in code? Let's take a look. 
<br>
Before: (Note: This is indeed the same code block seen at the start of the page)
```java
  // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```
After: 
```java
  // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    int temp;
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
      temp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length-i-1] = temp;
    }
  }
```

> Passing all tests! <sub>(That is, until the CSE staff start hiding test cases...)</sub>

As you can see from the right-hand pane, the corrected code is passing all test cases including the 2 inputs we considered above. 

# Part 3: Reflecting on new learnings! 
My work in the past 2 labs has given me a lot of practice in things I already knew, and gave me many new things to write notes and think about!
> During the week 3 lab, I definitely felt uncomfortable


Week 2 was interesting to me because I have extensive web development experience, but most of my full-stack experience comes from the Django (Python) framework and so looking at the URI class in Java and working more closely with server-side code (as opposed to mostly importing Django classes and using tools that were already built-in) was really interesting. It was nice to have a bit of a challenge without feeling out of my depth! It was also really interesting to learn more about network ports on computers and being able to run multiple servers on the networked computers- something I hadn't done before! 
<br>
During the week 3 lab, I definitely felt uncomfortable! I've never purposely fished for bugs, and it was weird running Windows commands on a Mac! Nonetheless, it was a good experience and I think I need to reflect on why I didn't want to purposely test for bugs or explore code in this way!
