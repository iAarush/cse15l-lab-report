# Aarush's Week 1 Lab Report 
*Hi, I'm Aarush! In this tutorial, I'll help you log in to a 
course-specific account on **ieng6**, a remote server for UCSD students.*
<br>


**NOTE:**
>This tutorial is written for macOS and assumes you are on Ventura (13). Steps may not work on older macOS versions or other operating systems.

# Starting off
It's important that you have a course-specific account for CSE 15L set up before you begin. Without this, you won't be able to use SSH (short for **Secure SHell**) to log on to the server.

You can also use the link above to look up your username and check your account's permissions. After you reset your password, it may take 15 minutes to update and reflect on the server. 
# Step 1: Installing VS Code
Visual Studio Code, commonly referred to as VS Code or VSC, is one of the most popular text editors used today. You can use the link below to download VS Code for your device: 
> https://code.visualstudio.com/

After it's installed and set up, it should look similar to this when you first open it:

Then, navigate to the terminal menu and select the button to create a new terminal:

After clicking on this button, a terminal will appear on the bottom half of your screen. If it's too small, it may be a good idea to resize it and make it bigger!

It's time for the next step!

# Step 2: SSHing

```bash
 $ this is a command on your own computer
```
